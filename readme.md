Intro
---
This is a fun project for me to learn about computer vision. I'm primarily using [opencv](https://opencv.org/) to manipulate pokemon images and generate silhouettes.

Ideas
---
Apart from the base game, I would like to add different levels of difficulties or hints (this is WIP)
- Making the game harder:
    - Adding rotations/distortions
    - Using newer pokemon generations

- Making the game easier:
    - Showing the primary colors in the silhouettes
    - Showing information (eg. pokemon type)
    - Using older pokemon generations
    - Other ideas, but mostly about image processing
